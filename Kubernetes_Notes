Kubernetes(K8S)

Kubernetes = container management system that ensures your apps run reliably, scale automatically, and recover from failures.

- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform
- It was originally developed by Google, now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
- It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Without Kubernetes:

- You’d have to manually start/stop containers.
- Handle crashes, scaling, and networking yourself.

With Kubernetes:

- Self-healing: Restarts failed containers automatically.
- Load balancing: Distributes traffic between pods.
- Scaling: Adds/removes containers when needed.
- Rolling updates: Deploy new app versions with zero downtime.
- Resource management: Efficiently uses CPU/RAM.



Cluster → A group of machines (nodes).
Control Plane (Master Node) → manages the cluster.
Worker Nodes → run applications.
Pod → Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes (1 or more containers).
Deployment → Manages pods, scaling, and rolling updates.
Service → Exposes pods inside or outside the cluster (stable networking).
ConfigMap & Secret → Store app configuration and sensitive data.
Namespace → Virtual cluster inside a cluster, helps organize resources.



High-Level Architecture

API Server → Entry point (kubectl talks to this).
Scheduler → Decides which node runs a pod.
Controller Manager → Ensures cluster desired state = actual state.
etcd → Key-value store (brain of the cluster).
Kubelet → Runs on each worker node, manages pods.
Kube Proxy → Handles network routing.








#kubectl cluster-info  =========> Shows information about the cluster (API server, DNS, etc.).

#kubectl get nodes =============> Lists all nodes in the cluster and their status.

#kubectl get namespaces  =======> 



#kubectl get pods   ======>  Lists pods in the current namespace.

#kubectl get pods -o wide  ====> Shows pods with more details (node, IP, etc.).

#kubectl describe pod <pod-name>  ====> Shows detailed info about a specific pod.

#kubectl describe node <node-name>  ====> Shows detailed info about a specific node.

#kubectl logs <pod-name>
